# Resturaunt-Management-System
As the saying goes “people eat with their eyes”, We have built a restaurant
management system which can be used by administration to handle the clients and
their orders. This self-service restaurant is equipped with a friendly menu and a
systematic ordering and billing process to enhance user experience.

Digital systems reduce manual errors.Our main motive is that the entire process
could be carried out by the customer with ease. The following objectives help us
achieve it.

❏ To reduce no. of employees hence the labour cost.

❏ To speed up the ordering and billing process hence increase leisure time.

❏ To efficiently store bill records and ease out access to orders for the
administrator.

❏ To cater to requisites of customers based on their occasion.

❏ To establish a nexus among customer, cashier and the digital device hence
print a bill at customer’s table.

❏ To take feedback from customers
